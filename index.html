Anyone in your organization can learn to write spun specs.  If
you've viewed the example above then you almost know enough to
figure the rest out.
</p><h3>Universal</h3><p>One of Selenium's downfalls is the number of bindings out
there for various programming languages.  Not only are there bindings
for several languages, there are multiple variations of each binding
for different coding preferences.  This makes it harder for larger
groups of developers and QA to agree on a solution.

spun is a universal selenium DSL (Domain Specific Language) that
compiles down to any programming language of choice.  Spun utilizes
provider modules that handle outputting actual code.  Because of this
you can run compiled spun files in any language of choice so long as
there is a provider written to do the compilation.
</p><h3>Intuitive</h3><p>Spun favors declaration over imperative programming.  This makes it
easier to learn and understand for anyone with a non-technical
background.

Spun understands the commands you need to verify that your site is
working correctly.
</p><h3>Maintainable</h3><p>The traditional approach to maintaining large selenium projects is
to create page objects.  Page objects add complication, and prevent
non-technical people from authoring specs.</p></div></body></html>
